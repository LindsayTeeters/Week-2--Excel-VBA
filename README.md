# Week-2--Excel-VBA
**Purpose**

We are assisting Steve with an analysis of different stock trading from 2017 and 2018. Steve and his parents will use this data to help aid in their decisions. This challenge is a more effective code than what was done in the module 2 that we also provide to Steve.

**Data Background**

The data contain within the file are from various stocks. We have two tabs which each contain one year (2017 and 2018).

Each year contains ticker, date, volume, open/ close trading, high/low trading, and the adjusted close trading of each stock. The name of the stock is listed as the Stock Trading name. It would be a good idea to include a reference sheet for Steve, when he analyzes our data. Two macro-enable buttons are included to produce/clear the refactor code.

This will help Steve loop through his stock data for his analysis.
